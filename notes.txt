see in next the frontend must be connected to database and when we build it will genrate a static page and ot get rid of that 
and make it dynamic we have to use 



we have to use in thses above anyone 

by just build bun run build database must be connected and that only if i do npm run dev it won't make right



we have nextjs project and and we run npm run dev alluser in frontend will look crt 
and if i add more user it will show me but when we run inproduction mode like bun run build
and during this page it will coneect to databse and make the pages static and it advantage is for seo 
wher page server google nice.and if i run in production mode bun run start and now it is file some where in 
folder which will not generate over time and we update in databse now it will not show hence whenever
we add anything in frontend and it store in databse means we have to build it again.

and to fix it we have to use these see down 
//And at end of our file we have to add thses and make it dynamic

// export const revalidate = 60 // revalidate every 60 seconds
// or
// export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'


and in docker file which we make to build it and thser if we donot want database means we donot need to add database connection and if we want means we need to add these above code and 
connect to databse in docker file

and hence understand this 
why nextjs project Dockerfile becomes tricky
when nextjs needs to talk to database during the build phase 
not only this or any project also okk

first stop databse locally docker kill addid and 
next run bun run build
build pipeline will fail
when we build backend and ws means it will build but the nextjs won't build 
and now we need to provide database url beacuse in code we fetching data from datasbse right so 
for that we give ligid DATABASE_URL here
so here in databse u see docker how we use the args cmds so when we run production these will help
and why beacause we cnnot hardcore in docker file abt databse credential like password and other things right 

so see down build cmd for web nextjs docker file to build where i passed database url
start from 1:15

goal is to deploy project by ci-cd 
dev => github =>  ubuntu => in this we write thses frontend down cmd
                    ||   
                     =>    dockerhub and deploy to vm


//cmds to build all three files
for backend 
docker build -t todo-app-backend -f ./docker/Dockerfile.backend .

for ws
docker build -t todo-app-ws -f ./docker/Dockerfile.ws .

for frontend 
docker build --build-arg DATABASE_URL="postgres" -t todo-app-backend -f ./docker/Dockerfile.frontend .
make todo-app-frontend while i didnot make 

//to run database db cmd
docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
